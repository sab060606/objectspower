        Why do we value the objects we value? </h2>
        <p>Objects and Power examines the systems surrounding collections, investigating how history is told through the acquisition, presentation, and interpretation of art, artifacts, and texts. The ten artists in the exhibition address varied topics that speak to how objects relate to power, such as the roots of collecting and museums; instances of extraction, theft, and erasure; themes of Indigeneity, access, and ownership; and examples of artists and community groups telling stories and imbuing power to objects on their own terms. Museums, libraries, and archives are repositories of objects and information that tell narratives about human history. While these organizations carry a weight of authority regarding art, artifacts, and documents, institutions are not neutral; connections to wealth, conquest, and extraction are woven throughout their holdings and infrastructure. While many institutions are doing work to confront the complicated provenance within their collections, Objects and Power features contemporary artists who consider these problems in their work—either directly or by circumvention. Be it through unpacking and critiquing power structures or through material directly carrying power in resistance, Objects and Power connects the dots between the objects we care about and the “work” these objects are doing. </p>
